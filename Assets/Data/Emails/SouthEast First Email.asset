  _content: "Dear <PlayerName>,\r\n\r\nAs you might already know since the rumours
    generally fly ahead, the forensics from the military police have discovered an
    unmanned body last month.\r\n\r\nContrarily to the rumour, it wasn't active when
    found, but already in an extremely degraded shape. As per usual we have sent
    a forensic unit but it is the first time they have ever been faced to this type
    of challenge.\r\n\r\nAs it seems, the body has been violently attacked and left
    in several pieces next to a ditch. The police unfortunately botched a large part
    of the recovery, but after a second search by our own teams we managed to retrieve
    about 90% of its remains, with the head being the more affected.\r\n\r\nLuckily,
    the memory blocks of this cyberbrain aren't located only in the head, but in
    several computing units scattered across the body, each one seemingly managing
    their own paths of memory, and functions. It is an extremely embedded architecture
    that also features a strange self-corrupting function, or virus. It is unclear
    whether this effect has been intended by its designers or if it is the result
    of an external attack.\r\n\r\nThe self-corrupting function however poses a very
    challenging problem, since the more time we spend with the data open, the more
    scrambled it becomes; sometimes it looks as if it's been even rewritten, in a
    fashion that has some form of... fantasy. It would be difficult to describe in
    another way. Most of its memory however, seems to be traces of the life of quite
    a normal person; that person might have been the cover the unmanned unit used,
    but we aren't sure of this. You'll see, there are iterations that are quite depressing.\r\n\r\nEverything
    is strange with this case. It is unpleasant to accept the idea we hadn't see
    it coming at all. Since you are one of our most cutting edge researchers, the
    board has decided to forward this case to you\u2014you have the maximal clearance
    on its scope.\r\n\r\nOur goals in this investigation are to:\r\n- identify the
    persons, unique or multiple, the body has impersonated;\r\n- identify the organizations,
    unique or multiple, that are behind its program;\r\n- identify the goals and
    targets of such organizations;\r\n- identify the people and entities that have
    been in contact with the unmanned body;\r\n- stabilize and preserve the data
    that has been recovered;\r\n- collect more data or addresses that would lead
    to further information;\r\n- any other information you might find relevant to
    the case.\r\n\r\nWe wish to collect as much data and information possible so
    the intelligence team can in their turn assess the level of threat. By principle,
    consider this whole thing as maximally hazardous and a potential national threat.\r\n\r\nHereby
    is your personal key to access the base interface.\r\n\r\nAny information that
    you would need for fulfilling your mission, please introduce a clearance request
    and I'd be happy to follow it up to suit your needs the best I can.\r\n\r\nPlease
    let me know if you need any other information. Anyway, this case is on your hands
    now.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nSouthEast"
