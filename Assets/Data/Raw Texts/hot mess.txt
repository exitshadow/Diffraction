administration of chaos

an exploration narrative game with rogue elements

loosely

you are a forensic technician hired to recover memories from the body (bodies?) of a cyborg. the memories are dark, glitchy, and the glitches become worse and worse as you progress inside the memory. the glitches are triggered by time spent, as well as certain hot spots. during the dive you can recover entry codes to use with a crystal sphere and a prism that you own in your lab. you can use these codes later if you take note of them to shortcut certain pages and avoid permanent death. during the dive, some characters or points will talk to you and the only way to save it is to remember it yourself. (or use a damn pen and paper.) outside of the dive you can use your codes to decypher partially corrupted data and have access to more elements of the story which might contradict what you have occasionally seen. at the end of the game you end up with a corpus of texts that you can reorganize, if you wish so, telling you a story that remains incomplete, but makes more sense than nothing at all.

**

as players will find bits and pieces in different orders, they'll tend to anchor on the first option and sequence of events their perception of the past is therefore heavily linked into the perception of reality the general idea behind all this being that memory is unreliable, but therefore closely knitted to imagination and invention

the general atmosphere of the game is one of grief, sadness, confusion, but also amazement. as the glitches and the bugs will not survene in the same times (and are relatively triggering), each experience is slightly different, angles aren't the same, and the player's brain is left to reconstruct the missing bits and parts, also letting themselves dive in the shaders and the sounds as someone would listen to a noise track.

some texts

as a dawn upon non time, once i woke up to something i never saw before, neither afterwards. as with many myths and legends and visions or dreams, that place was so remote, yet so familiar it was as if i never left it and since the day i was born and the day that received anything similar to light, this was were to remain, lying down to quietly end. this place of dreams i dreamed to bring it with me every time sadness happened, but i couldn't--i couldn't even let transpire what was so particular in here, that sort of peaceful disquiet.

**

now with the age of digital sharing perhaps--perhaps my dream of bringing dream can become true. i long for sharing and showing this place of my heart to those i love, if only. cruelly i feel that there is no one on this planet that i would particularly enjoy the company, as all the ones i do know have been consumed by hate as a thousand flames, blades and poisons that curse their mind. as i write i do realize this all feels very dramatic, but these people exist.

**

as time goes by i fear being one of them so much.

**

and i go exploring this place of mine and my heart a bit more every day; i found a sheep bearing a dark, glowing crown. it is friendly and quiet, not scared as sheep usually are; probably i am more afraid of it than it is of me. i wished it could speak, and that i could speak this language, that of animals.

**

knits and bits and pieces, that's how i feel my feelings scattered around. this is fine and the tech said it was normal. but it seems that part of the person i was before, that is the one i was merely yesterday, is gone. my favourite place also, is gone. unsettling. but hey, there are so many things to do with this new shape, and truly it feels like i could do absolutely anything. only now i realise in how much pain i was and in comparison this new nothingness is a form of heaven, a sea of quiet where nothing will ever happen anymore.

**

at times i still do miss the barbarity [...] and how simple it was.

**

noises ago around the bed, i can hear [...] sneezing and if before it would have driven me utterly mad, now all i have to do is to simply shut down and dive and wait. [...] body became fortress.

**

got rid of the cat. got rid of steven.

**

there are [...] traces of the sheep. i mean, literally, footprints, footprints of its little hooves, inserted cross the sand.

**

also, a sort of horse.

**

he came back, then left?

**

it is a joy of every day to contemplate the sky with entirely new eyes. i have been awarded with a new life, with a mind of its own. it is as if, i could sense life through someone else, someone more competent, more beautiful, more intelligent, more heartfelt. digitazition also does comprehend the intelligence of heart, and as it seems, even their skin, nails and hair can think. i cannot clearly understand what they know but fleetingly, i can have as an impression of an opinion, as one might perceive a vague irritation or warmth coming from somebody else. the fortress has an operating system that is increasingly distinct from me.

**

sometimes i do write here just as not to loose momentum? i don't have much to say. in truth, i never had. men i trust, that is just the idea of someone else.

**

a man came to me yesterday and told me so many horrors; truly the world is an insufferable place.

**

there are things that you only can know and yet every time they happen they come as the same, tepid, horrible, unbearable surprise. i am content to have left the mass of this feeling--yet its remnants only seem enough as to chase my mind every day and every second, as a sort of ghost that only appears in negatives, by the absence of something else.

**

fortunately [...] as the very entire archival plate was made out of metal, he couldn't destroy it, and the corners did rip his bag. however it remained lost for a long time, and whereas sheer brutality couldn't do anything, the corrosion of time sooner or later wins. they were entire threads of my life and history that disappeared with that plate, and it took a long time [...] knowing it wouldn't be anymore. now life also has made its work and, while not every day comes or goes easily, it seems more possible to just [...] operate, and not ask too many questions. the worst still remains at the dawn of the new day, and at dusk when the night tells you how long it'll be, at the beginning of things everything always seems so infinite, for best and worst; i still do not know whether i long for that feeling of lingering hope that comes with new beginnins or if i just feel infinitely tired because of everything that has yet, to come.

**

little birds! with their lovely hues that i can see now.

**

tech said i should tidy my logs better, since everything still is experimental. i'm more than a feature? i agreed to this.

**

override control, that doesn't matter anymore. nothing matters anymore. it never did.

**

terrible nights give birth to the brightest days--i do not know who's the idiot who thought that.

**

i'm a terrible person.

**

they are a terrible person.

**

sheep said "for the salvation of all things that breathe and think, you shall go as far of yourself as you can, and observe the grey sea beyond." [...] would be nice [...] some holidays.

**

work's been so hard lately steve is doing it all, relentlessly. he's the loveliest person one can be. the most balanced man i ever met, it doesn't seem really possible when one thinks of it. but so he's been, always affectionate, always full of care and good intentions and benevolence and little things to eat and say; being next to him feels like being cushioned by the densest pillows of psychological comfort. this makes me hate him with such profusion, and i know it doesn't make any sense. rationally i cannot find a single reason steve would be evil, still i find myself waiting for proof, as if love was forever blocked in my heart, mind and body. every time i sense something close to a warmth of affection the entire system shuts down not in terror but in heartlessness and my mind is cold and my mind is superior; as far as it knows everything that was and everything that is to come; a burning snake hisses to my mind and the snake knows better, the reality of metal and the reality of crystals; the knowledge that comes with totality. it is normal, that steve is struggling to adjust. this isn't me anymore.

**

today i could understand my hands were thinking, it's hard to describe.

**

shouldn't have. let it go.

**

there is more to me than the sum of my parts [...] ? fuck you aristotle

**

so we went to the beach at the end and the day was disgusting but in that way that makes you feel like it's all right and all good and everything falls in place perfectly to make a perfect day of cozy bliss; the rain and steve near me and the damp warmth of the end of spring mixing up with the dampness of his clothes and body, an umbrella [...] cat came back tonight! but mom called and it was, fucking infinite. i do not know what this woman is to me, and since the fortress i think i am comfortable saying that even, bonds of blood aren't true anymore, or only if her blood is as iridescent and dark as mine is now, i saw it the other day when the arm broke open, it was fascinating and it didn't hurt. truly i am delivered from pain [...] there was so much, so much pain.

**

smells like a wet dog [...]

**

ah he couldn't see nor understand and now it's too late one cannot undo what has been done i'll never be capable to draw a line over the past--how can something that merely exists be the beginning of every single fucking day every single day one opens their eyes to the world that remains barely changed from the day before, stacking ghosts that never cease to bite this is too much, this is fucking too much, i just want it to stop.

**

steve left

**

tried to call the tech this behaviour isn't normal i think

**

taking the advice of. a. damn... sheep

**

non linear interpolation. i like it
